Pulmoro simplifies arterial blood gas interpretation, ventilator management, and respiratory calculations through clear, intuitive tools built for intensive care environments. Created by a practicing Respiratory Therapist, the app supports fast, accurate decision making at the bedside.

## About Pulmoro

Pulmoro is a Swift and SwiftUI, built clinical utility app that streamlines respiratory care by providing real time ABG interpretations, ventilator guidance, and medical calculators in a clear, structured interface. Designed from the perspective of a respiratory therapist, it merges over eight years of clinical experience with practical iOS development and technical design. The app focuses on speed, clarity, and safety through simple outputs, color-coded alerts, and offline processing with no data collection. Pulmoro was selected as a winner in the 2025 Apple Swift Student Challenge (WWDC) and continues to evolve based on real clinician feedback and real world workflow needs.


# Development Journey

The development of Pulmoro, from wireframe to App Store submission, was a 10 month process. It began as a project for the Swift Student Challenge, but after winning the competition, I continued building the app so clinicians could actually use it and provide feedback. That feedback has helped me iterate on the design and expand Pulmoro into a more complete clinical tool.

### Code

Pulmoro was built as both a clinical tool and a personal learning journey. While developing the app, I was actively learning Swift and SwiftUI, which pushed me to adopt clean architecture, reusable components, and structured problem solving. Building Pulmoro taught me practical GitHub workflows, how to document code properly with DocC, and how to design logic systems that scale. The project became a hands on way to strengthen my coding skills while creating something clinicians can rely on.

- Swift  
- SwiftUI  
- SwiftData  
- SF Symbols  
- Decision-tree logic implemented using Swift dictionaries



### Development Takeaways

- Built robust ABG interpretation logic using layered decision trees  
- Created reusable SwiftUI components for rapid calculator development  
- Implemented consistent navigation and toolbars across 15+ calculators  
- Optimized folder structure for long-term scalability  
- Leveraged view modifiers to maintain consistent design patterns  
- Added DocC documentation to create a library of functions and structs  



### Design

Pulmoro is designed for clarity and efficiency. The design process followed a user centered approach. The foundation of the app was formed from interviews with clinicians and direct experience working as a respiratory therapists. These insights shaped the app’s workflows, structure, and visual language, drawing inspiration from charting systems and ventilators commonly used in critical care. The interface was developed from low-fidelity sketches to high-fidelity designs and a complete style guide, ensuring consistency and accessibility throughout the app. Even the logo reflects Pulmoro’s focus on respiratory care and clinical support.

- Minimalist interface with strong visual hierarchy  
- Clinical color theory for alerts and indicators  
- Familiar workflows modeled after real clinical decision-making  
- Full accessibility support (Dynamic Type, proper contrast ratios)  



### Design Takeaways

- SF Symbols to enhance recognition and navigation  
- Structured information flow to mirror real clinician thought processes  
- Applied visual hierarchy to prioritize critical patient data  
- Balanced simplicity with functional depth through consistent UI patterns and a detailed style guide  
- Ensured accessible color contrast and scalable typography across all calculators and screens

# What’s Next?

Pulmoro’s roadmap focuses on expanding its depth and usability. Upcoming updates include more advanced ventilator management algorithms, additional specialized respiratory calculators, new case studies and educational content, and tools for ARDS and ECMO preparation. A ventilator simulator is also planned for a future release to further enhance learning and decision support capabilities.
