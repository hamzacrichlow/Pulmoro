## How to Use Pulmoro
Pulmoro is a specialized clinical decision support application designed for healthcare professionals managing respiratory patients. Developed by me - a practicing Respiratory Therapist - this tool equips physicians, nurses, RT specialists, and critical care teams with real-time ABG interpretation, ventilator management calculations, and evidence-based treatment recommendations. Users can quickly analyze arterial blood gases, calculate optimal respiratory parameters, and access case studies for continuing educationâ€”all through an intuitive interface optimized for high-pressure clinical environments. By providing immediate access to critical calculations and decision support, Pulmoro helps reduce medical errors, standardize care protocols, and improve patient outcomes in intensive care, emergency medicine, and pulmonary settings.

### Key Features
- Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Interpreter: Analyzes ABG lab values and provides treatment recommendations
- Ventilator Management Tools: Suggests appropriate settings based on patient parameters and lab values
- Medical Calculator Suite: Specialized calculators for respiratory assessment and treatment planning
- Educational Components: Detailed guides explaining clinical relevance and calculation methods
- Visual Alert System: Color-coded indicators for quick identification of abnormal values

## Development Journey
This repository documents my ongoing process of building Pulmoro. As the sole designer and developer, I've created this application entirely in Swift and SwiftUI using Xcode. The project uniquely combines my seven years of clinical experience as a Respiratory Therapist with my technical design skills, allowing me to create tools that address real needs I've observed in healthcare settings. Throughout development, I've conducted extensive research across medical literature to ensure all calculations and recommendations maintain clinical accuracy. This ongoing project represents my commitment to creating truly useful applications for healthcare professionals by bridging my dual expertise in respiratory care and iOS development.

### Frameworks
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- CoreData
- SF Symbols

#### Development Takeaways
- Implemented complex decision trees using Swift dictionaries to create a robust treatment recommendation system
- Mastered SwiftUI navigation tools and toolbar customization to maintain consistent app navigation
- Discovered how to create reusable view structures that accelerated development of new calculator pages
- Enhanced code organization through strategic view modifiers and modular view components
- Established efficient folder architecture in Xcode to manage growing project complexity

## Design Philosophy
My approach prioritizes clinical efficiency through minimalist aesthetics and thoughtful information architecture. Every visual element serves a specific purpose, using SF symbols and consistent typography to enhance navigation while eliminating distractions. By mirroring established clinical workflows, Pulmoro integrates seamlessly into patient care, making complex ventilator management accessible through familiar design patterns.

#### Design Takeaways
- Implemented SF Symbols in contextually appropriate ways to enhance navigation and recognition
- Applied healthcare-specific color theory principles to create visual alert systems that align with clinical priorities
- Designed information architecture that mirrors existing clinical thought processes to reduce learning curve
- Created a visual hierarchy that prioritizes critical patient data while maintaining clean aesthetic

## Roadmap (in progress...)
